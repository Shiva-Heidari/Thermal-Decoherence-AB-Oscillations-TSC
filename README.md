# Thermal Decoherence of Aharonov–Bohm Oscillations in Topological Superconducting Edge Channels

This project analyzes how thermal fluctuations suppress quantum coherence in a helical edge state of a 2D topological superconductor. By using the Luttinger liquid formalism and bosonization techniques, we derive an analytical formula for the Aharonov–Bohm (AB) oscillation amplitude as a function of temperature and interaction strength.

## Theoretical Highlights
- Helical Luttinger Liquid model on a ring geometry
- Finite-temperature bosonic correlation functions
- AB amplitude crossover: power-law at low-T, exponential decay at high-T
- Phase shift from flux threading encoded in the zero-mode sector

## Results
- Analytic formula:  
  $$ A(T) \sim \left(\frac{T}{T_\phi}\right)^\alpha e^{-\alpha T/T_\phi} $$
- Interaction strength encoded in \( \alpha = \frac{1}{2}(K + \frac{1}{K}) - 1 \)
- AB interference is preserved at \( T \to 0 \), destroyed at high \( T \)
